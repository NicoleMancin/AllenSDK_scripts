# AllenSDK_scripts

Code to access the Allen Brain Connectivity Atlas via AllenSDK.
A series of examples are provided in the scripts.
For more detailed information and examples, look at:

Before starting, remind that you have to install the allenSDK package on anaconda. I suggest creating a virtual environment specifically for it, as works on older versions of python.
